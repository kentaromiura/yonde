The idea came from [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro),
The main code is instead from my [Sakubi reader app](https://github.com/kentaromiura/sakubi-reader-app)
OCR code is a port of [Koharu](https://github.com/mayocream/koharu) from [candle framework](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) to [burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) as the latter supports AMD gpus better, original library is under https://github.com/mayocream/koharu/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE which is compatible with the project MIT.
